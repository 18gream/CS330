# How do I approach designing software?
  # What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  # What design process did you follow for your project work?
  # How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  This project helped me develop new design skills in terms of applying textures and lighting to a 3D scene, as well as creating meshes and altering previous mesh shapes to new ones. The design process I followed for this project was to take one assingment at a time and then apply them all to the final project. Understanding the requirements and what was needed to alter the code helped me follow a design process to get to the end result. Tactics from my design approach could be applied in future work through future projects, possible carreers, and the gained confidence I have now from working with new computational graphics and design knowledge. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
  # What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  # How did iteration factor into your development?
  # How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  New development strategies I used while working on the 3D scene was taking code that was provided and using it elsewhere where I needed it. For example, when creating a mesh, I used the given code and copied it to the next shape and built on it. This also plays into how iteration factored into development, because when one shape would need texture/lighting/etc, I would take the code for the previous shape and use that but alter it to the new shapes' needs. My approach has evolved through the milestones by gaining an understanding of 3D and 2D shapes and building/configuring them as well as how lighting and texture can effect a shape. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  # How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational 
  # pathway?
  # How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Compuational graphics and visualization gives me knowledge that can be applied in my future educational pathway because I have gained more knowledge and confidence working with graphics that I previously did not have any on. Some of this in one way or another will more than likely continue into future courses, whether it be working with code or just have a general understanding of 3D graphics. As for future professional pathways, I do not plan on pursuing any career in computational graphics, but I will always have the gained skills for future reference or if I ever wanted to do a career change.
